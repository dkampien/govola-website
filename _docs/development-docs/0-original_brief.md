(generic hook, demo video, CTA) 


Key features (V1):

App with ONLY TikTok API integration 
App can post videos on connected TikTok accounts
App can get analytics from videos posted on the connected TikTok accounts 
App generated videos mixes from pre-determined content, combining video, text & audio with different lengths 

Other Requirements: 

In order to create the App and get it approved by TikTok, we’ll need a presentation website. 

We’ll develop an entire presentation website for a social tool that will get approved by TikTok in order to be able to use its API. 

The website needs to have: 

A clear product/idea presented on multiple pages 
A T&C 
A Privacy Policy 
Credible presentation and trust factors built in
A dedicated domain with email integration

Maintenance: 

Developer will provide maintenance in case any services go down due to minor changes or errors (major TikTok updates not included)
Developer will provide 1 backup app/website in case the TikTok app gets disapproved 
Integration with the TikTok V2 API (future updates not included) 
 
Timing: 

TikTok App submission by Sept 1st
2 weeks testing when approved (1-2 weeks approval time estimate) 
1 week fine tuning 

Ideal Launch Date: end of September
