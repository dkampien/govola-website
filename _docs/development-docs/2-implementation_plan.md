# Implementation Plan for GoVola Content Engine Website

## Phase 1: Dependencies & Configuration
1. **Install utility packages:**
   - clsx (conditional classNames)
   - tailwind-merge (handle Tailwind class conflicts)
   - lucide-react (consistent icon set)

2. **Configure Design System:**
   - Set up Vola brand colors (#4A90E2, #F7D917) in Tailwind config
   - Create consistent spacing/sizing tokens
   - Define typography scale
   - **Create cn() utility function** to standardize class merging across all components

## Phase 2: Project Structure
1. **Create app routes:**
   - /about - Company credibility page
   - /privacy - Privacy Policy page  
   - /terms - Terms & Conditions page

2. **Create component architecture:**
   - src/components/sections/ (homepage sections)
   - src/components/ui/ (reusable components)
   - src/components/animations/ (animated elements)
   - **src/lib/utils.ts** (cn function and shared utilities)
   - **src/styles/design-tokens.ts** (centralized design constants)

## Phase 3: Design System Foundation
**PRIORITY: Coherent and consistent design across all components**

1. **Create base component wrappers:**
   - StandardSection component (consistent padding/margins)
   - Container component (max-width and responsive padding)
   - Typography components (H1, H2, P with consistent styles)
   
2. **Standardize component integration:**
   - Create adapter components for external libraries
   - Apply consistent color/spacing overrides
   - Ensure all components use the cn() utility
   - Document style conventions in comments

## Phase 4: Core Components
1. **Build foundational UI components:**
   - Navigation header with mobile menu
   - Footer with consistent styling
   - Button component (primary/secondary variants using Vola colors)
   - Card component for feature sections

2. **Create the animated flow hero:**
   - SVG-based flow visualization
   - CSS animations (no Framer Motion initially)
   - Single input → processing → multiple outputs design
   - Vola blue gradient (#4A90E2) with yellow accents (#F7D917)

## Phase 5: Homepage Implementation
1. **Hero Section:**
   - Animated flow visual as centerpiece
   - "Create Once. Distribute Everywhere." headline
   - Consistent button styling

2. **Problem/Solution Section:**
   - Before vs After cards with matching styles
   - Consistent typography and spacing

3. **How It Works Section:**
   - 3-step process with unified icon style
   - Matching card designs

4. **Features Section:**
   - 4 feature cards with consistent design
   - Same hover effects across all cards

5. **Company Section:**
   - Trust indicators with cohesive styling
   - Awards and metrics display

6. **Contact/CTA Section:**
   - Final CTA matching primary button style
   - Consistent form styling if needed

## Phase 6: Legal Pages
1. **About Page:**
   - Extended company information
   - Consistent with main site typography

2. **Privacy Policy Page:**
   - Legal content with readable formatting
   - Consistent header/footer

3. **Terms & Conditions Page:**
   - Service terms with same styling as Privacy
   - Proper section hierarchy

## Phase 7: Deployment
1. **Vercel Deployment Setup:**
   - Connect GitHub repository
   - Configure environment variables if needed
   - Set up custom domain (when ready)
   - Enable analytics

2. **Pre-deployment checks:**
   - Build verification (`npm run build`)
   - Type checking passes
   - No console errors
   - All links functional

## Optional Phases (if time permits):

### Performance Optimization:
- Image optimization with next/image
- Font loading optimization  
- Lazy loading for below-fold content
- Animation performance tuning

### Quality Assurance:
- Cross-browser testing
- Lighthouse audit
- Accessibility review
- Mobile responsiveness verification

**Key Focus:** Maintaining design coherence across all components, especially when integrating from multiple sources. Every component must feel part of the same system through consistent use of colors, spacing, typography, and interactions.
